I’m currently working at Alibaba.ir, An online travel shopping company. And from the open-source perspective, I’m spending my time working on a free library for vue@3, called GHOSTAX.
I mostly use HTML, CSS, JS, and Vue. On top of these, I have experience with NodeJS and MongoDB, and I occasionally do UI design.  

These are some of my interesting projects that I enjoyed working on:  

- __GHOSTAX__ | Set of UI-less components. Using Vue@3's composition API and slot scoped concept.
- __LastScene__ | An Electron based application to manage and categorize you movies and tv shows. It ws a personal project and it was made with NodeJS and mongoDB.
- __Together__ | A Fast, small, secure, and anonymous chat client, Used for communication between employees and C-levels in a company.
- __Klassify__ | Documentation platform to be used alongside Front-End codes. Something like Storybook, but more focused on documentation itself, rather than components demo.
- __vue-container-queries-2__ | Vue plugin to give the opportunity to the developer to use container queries before it gets to the browsers.
