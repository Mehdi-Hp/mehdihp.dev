My name is Mehdi HoseiniPajooh. I'm practically a [Front-End designer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/), based in Tehran, Iran. It’s 10 years now since I’ve started coding on the web platform.  
I am Kinda into animes, Adventure Time, and mechanical keyboards!
I enjoy working with web technologies, and I spend most of my free time on open-source projects and libraries. This gives me a exciting reason to wake up every morning and take my steps!

Also, I write about HTML, CSS, JS, Vue, and things I learn on a daily basis, in my [blog](/blog) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mehdi_HoseiniP).
