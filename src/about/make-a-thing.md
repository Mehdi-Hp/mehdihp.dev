I am currently utilizing the Vue framework, prefer no CSS UI kits, and would be happy to maintain projects from the ground up.  
Besides that, I can particularly help you if:  

- You want to initialize a project, and you need a robust structure.
- You want a modern and optimized codebase, using the latest web technologies.
- You have problems with clean CSS.
- You need to have structured documentation for your projects.
- You care about accessibility, the amount you should care about.
